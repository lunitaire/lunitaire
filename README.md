 My name is Atrian. I am a developer, designer, and artist.
 
 My college degree is in computer graphics. I worked in design before pivoting to working in the tech industry. I have taken on many roles over the years, including multiple engineering titles. My most recent title was software engineer before I switched to working for myself.
 
 Working for myself means I do a bit of everything, but my favorite tasks revolve around code, design, and the combination of the two.

As cool as these contribution widgets are, they are not accurate, ie a number of projects I have worked on over the years have not been hosted on Github.
